## The Hardest Thing in Design Might Be Choosing Colors

Color Palette will save you time by helping you discover and create beautiful color combinations.
Rather than generate superficial palettes, Color Palette helps you make your own with all the primary color schemes:

- Triad
- Tetrad
- Analogous
- Monochromatic
- Complementary
- Split complementary
- Shades
- Tones
- Tints

### Find the Perfect Color

With spacious color pickers and scrubbers,
you'll always find the color you need.

### Never Lose a Color

The Undo feature tracks up to 100 colors,
and stashes them when you close the app.

### Work Offline

Wherever you are, or wherever you're going, Color Palette will be right behind you.

### Paste Your Colors Anywhere

With HEX, HSL, HSV and RGB detection,
you'll never need to focus on tiny inputs.

### Right-Click to Copy

Grab the color you want instantly,
even when the window is not in focus.

### Copy to Any Format

If Color Palette doesn't have the format you need, you can easily configure your own.

### Upgrade Your Mac Workflow

Support for Dark Mode, Touch Bar, and
all the handy shortcuts you'd expect.

### Organize Your Palettes

Store multiple lists of colors, sort them,
and easily switch in between them.

### View Colors in the Full Window

Hold the F key when picking or hovering
over a color to experience it in full.

### Create Your Own Color Schemes and Palettes

In today's world of simple designs, choosing the right colors matters more than ever.
Color Palette offers flexible controls that will help you find all the colors and variations you'd need.
